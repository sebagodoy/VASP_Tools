# VASP_Tools
This repository contains several python and bash tools written to ease and speed up the rutinary work with VASP files.
The repository is maintained by Sebastian Godoy, tested with Python 3.8.10 in a Ubuntu 20.04 setup.

To use in a Ubuntu setup just fork, copy or dowload in your machine. Add to your path for easy use from the terminal adding
PATH=$PATH:"/here goes the absolute path where you downloaded your tools"
to the ~/.bashrc file. Be sure to give the scripts persmission to run with chmod +x "File-Name".

The bash scripts for sending slurm jobs (Submit_slurm_vaspJob.sh) and checking the job log interact, chech the absolute directions inside the code and adapt properly to your system.

Have a nice day c:
